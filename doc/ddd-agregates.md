# TODO

The domain invariant is: "There can only be one zombie at the same time in the same wolrd cell".

* Explain how the problem is fixed (if it's really fixed) updating the whole state throw the aggregate root.

## Quotes

Vaughn Vernon:
> Aggregate is synonymous with transactional consistency boundary.

>  We cannot correctly reason on aggregate design without applying transactional analysis.
